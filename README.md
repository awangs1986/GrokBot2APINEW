# GrokBot2API

Private sidecar that translates a Grok Bot inference entitlement into a
Grok CLI / Pi Coding Agent compatible Responses API.

For Pi, use `api: "openai-responses"`. See the [Pi integration guide](docs/pi-agent.md)
and [models.json example](examples/pi/models.json). The pinned real-Pi CLI contract
tests use simulated upstream protocol frames, not a live Grok Bot account.

This repository is intentionally separate from Cursor2API. Grok Bot uses the
Cursor/Grok Bot `aiserver.v1.InferenceService/Stream` path and Grok Bot session
state. Cursor2API uses Cursor Dashboard keys and the Cursor SDK/AgentService
path. Keeping them separate makes rollback and credential boundaries clear.

## Current scope

P1 implements a Grok CLI/Sub2API Grok-account sidecar. The current
Grok CLI 1.0.5 custom-model contract was verified locally: with
`api_backend = "responses"` it sends `POST /v1/responses`,
`Accept: text/event-stream`, and a Responses-shaped body with `input[]`,
`tools`, `reasoning`, `include`, and `prompt_cache_key`.

- `GET /health`
- `GET /`, `/dashboard`, and `/v1` read-only dashboard
- `GET /v1/models` and `/models`
- `POST /v1/responses`, `/responses`, and `/backend-api/codex/responses`
- streaming SSE for text deltas and terminal `response.completed`
- function tool definitions, tool-call SSE events, and function-call-output
  continuation
- official-style tool request shaping: sanitized JSON schemas, stable per-session
  conversation IDs, conversation group IDs, no default max-token override, and
  no advertised-tool duplication into field 9
- non-streaming JSON Responses output
- 34 named catalog models in `/v1/models`, excluding `Auto`
- real upstream usage propagation when present
- structured error mapping
- single in-flight request guard
- short in-process cooldown after upstream rate-limit/resource-exhausted errors
- Bearer downstream key
- loopback bind by default
- credential loading from env/file, plus macOS Grok Bot Safe Storage for local
  development

It now claims Grok CLI text plus function-tool round-trip compatibility through
local fake-upstream tests. Pi CLI 0.87.0 text/function-tool round trips and error handling are also covered
by real-CLI tests with simulated upstream frames. Downstream disconnect now
propagates cancellation to the HTTPS upstream. Rich tool result content, live
upstream validation, and long-running Linux credential refresh remain follow-up
gates before treating it as a complete daily agent backend.

`/v1/models` includes the 34 named models observed from the current Grok Bot
`USER_AVAILABLE` catalog. `grok-4.5` is marked `verified`; the other catalog
models are marked `catalog_entitled` / `experimental` until each selected model
gets a controlled live smoke. The `default` / `Auto` entry is intentionally not
exposed.

## Run locally

```sh
cp -n .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set GROKBOT2API_KEY and configure the upstream credentials.
node --env-file=.env bin/grokbot2api.mjs
```

`--env-file` requires Node >=20.6. The service does not load `.env` automatically;
you can instead inject environment variables and run `npm start`. The curl example
below assumes you configured the downstream key as `local-dev-key`.

The service defaults to `127.0.0.1:8793`. Non-loopback bind is refused unless
`GROKBOT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_BIND=1` is set.

Request:

```sh
curl -sS -N http://127.0.0.1:8793/v1/responses \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer local-dev-key' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"grok-4.5","stream":true,"input":"Say ok."}'
```

Grok CLI local configuration:

```toml
[models]
default = "grokbot"

[model."grokbot"]
model = "grok-4.5"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8793/v1"
api_key = "local-dev-key"
api_backend = "responses"
context_window = 1000000
```

Dashboard:

```sh
open http://127.0.0.1:8793/dashboard
```

When running behind a path proxy, set `GROKBOT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so the dashboard
shows the correct client base URL.

Large Grok CLI/agent requests can include tool schemas that exceed the default
body cap. Set `GROKBOT_MAX_BODY_BYTES` only when needed:

```sh
GROKBOT_MAX_BODY_BYTES=8388608
```

The default is 1 MiB. The hard maximum is 16 MiB.

When upstream returns HTTP 429 or a Connect end-frame `resource_exhausted`, the
sidecar maps it to OpenAI-style `rate_limit_error` / 429 and briefly cools down
before accepting another upstream request:

```sh
GROKBOT_RATE_LIMIT_COOLDOWN_MS=30000
```

The default is 30 seconds. Set it to `0` to disable. The hard maximum is 5
minutes. This cooldown is process-local and resets on restart.

## Credential providers

The sidecar reads credentials on every request and never writes credentials.

Provider order:

1. `GROKBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `GROKBOT_MACHINE_ID`
2. `GROKBOT_CREDENTIALS_FILE`
3. `GROKBOT_CREDENTIALS_COMMAND`
4. macOS Grok Bot Safe Storage, only on Darwin

`GROKBOT_CREDENTIALS_COMMAND` is the preferred Linux bootstrap/refresh boundary.
It must be an absolute path, is executed without a shell on every request, and
must print a single JSON object:

```json
{"accessToken":"eyJ...","machineId":"...","clientVersion":"0.27.0"}
```

The sidecar validates token shape/expiry and machine id, then discards the
values after the request. It does not log command stdout/stderr, so helper errors
must be monitored at the helper/runtime layer.

For `.212` Linux deployment, first validate a Linux Grok Bot runtime such as
`Nichokas/grokbot-linux-port` in an isolated directory. The important gate is not
whether this Node service can run on Linux; it can. The gate is whether Linux can
maintain Grok Bot access token, machine id, client headers, and refresh without
manual token copying. Until that is verified, deploy only for controlled testing.

## Safety defaults

- no key, prompt, body, or tool arguments are logged by this service;
- 401, 403, and 429 from upstream are hard stops;
- concurrent calls return `429 concurrency_limited`;
- upstream 429 / `resource_exhausted` returns `429 upstream_rate_limited` and
  starts a short in-process cooldown;
- request bodies are capped at 1 MiB by default and can be explicitly raised up
  to 16 MiB with `GROKBOT_MAX_BODY_BYTES`;
- upstream responses are capped;
- the default bind address is loopback only.

## Verification

The development/contract-test dependency (Pi CLI 0.87.0) requires Node >=22.19.0.
The sidecar itself still has no runtime npm dependencies.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run test:pi
```

Pi tests run the real pinned CLI with isolated configuration and a simulated
Grok Bot transport. Passing them does not establish live account entitlement or
current upstream protocol compatibility. See the Pi guide for the live smoke gate.
